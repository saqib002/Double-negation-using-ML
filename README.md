# double-negation
ML model for double negation detection
****************Abstract from the research*******************

Good authors, comprehension writers and literature writers sometimes use double negatives in their writings. Therefore, to have an
idea about the comprehension writing skills of a person or to know,
which of the song writers are getting popular among young generation by using such type of double negatives and other rhetoric
figures in their lyrics, we need to work on an algorithm that could
detect such double negatives from a given text. In the current study
we are going to design a pipeline through which we will be able to
detect double negations in social media i.e., twitter. We will be implementing sentimental analysis to check the polarity of a sentence,
text mining and various text processing techniques will be used to
write its algorithm. We will compare how good is the sentimental
analysis feature for such text detection. Moreover, after obtaining
different features and applying different techniques contained in
the algorithm, Multinomial Na√Øve Bayes classifier will be implemented to classify the tweets. When accuracy parameters were
calculated, it was seen that the mentioned research is giving us
better results than the ones already done in the field.
